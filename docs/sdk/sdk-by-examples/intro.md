# SDK By Examples

**SDK by Examples** offers an alternative and complementary way to learn about the Cosmos-SDK. It contains several examples that showcase how to build a decentralised application on top of the Cosmos-SDK from start to finish.  

## Prerequisite reading

- [Intro to Tendermint and Cosmos](../../introduction/tendermint-cosmos.md)
- [Tendermint Core and ABCI](../../introduction/tendermint.md)

## Nameservice

-> [Access the Tutorial](/nameservice/README.ms) <- 

In this example you will learn from the bottom up to build a fully functional simple name service application similar to [Namecoin](https://namecoin.org/), [ENS](https://ens.domains/), or [Handshake](https://handshake.org/).


More examples will come soon!
